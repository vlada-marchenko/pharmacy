[00:26:55.345] Server  ERROR   ⨯ The file "./src/proxy.ts" must export a function, either as a default export or as a named "proxy" export.
This function is what Next.js runs for every request handled by this proxy (previously called middleware).

Why this happens:
- You are migrating from `middleware` to `proxy`, but haven't updated the exported function.
- The file exists but doesn't export a function.
- The export is not a function (e.g., an object or constant).
- There's a syntax error preventing the export from being recognized.

To fix it:
- Ensure this file has either a default or "proxy" function export.
